            it was the age of foolishness,<br/>
            it was epoch of belief,<br/>
            it was the epoch of incredulity,<br/>
            it was the season of light,<br/>
            it was the season of darkness,<br/>
            it was the spring of hope,<br/>
            it was the winter of despair,<br/>
            we had everything before us,<br/>
            we had nothing before us,<br/>

            we were all going direct the other way...<br/>
